Octopress-Header-Adder
======================

Header adder for Octopress Markdown Files

This is just a simple ruby script that adds some generic headers for Octopress. 

It's intended for those who convert all their html files to markup, it's a convienent way to drop some headers into it. 

To run it, simply type

```
ruby headeradd.rb
``` 

In the folder with your markdown files. It will add a generic header to the beginning of all of them. 

I wrote this for someone who had emailed the mailing list about it, and figured I would share it here, if one person benefits from it then it's worth the 10 minutes I put into it. 

Feel free to branch or shoot me ideas for improving it.
